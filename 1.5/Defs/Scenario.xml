        <description>Start with one pawn that has some bonuses that make it a bit more likely that things will go their way. Maybe this pawn will see the story to its end. Maybe they'll manage to create a colony that lasts long after their death. Or maybe the universe just has a cruel sense of humor, and they'll achieve nothing.</description>

            <summary>Start with just one pawn that usually has things go their way, and hope you don't lose them before they can convince some more people to join the colony.</summary>

        <description>This pawn seems to have things go their way more often than not. While they can't always do the impossible, the universe does seem to favor them for some reason.</description>
