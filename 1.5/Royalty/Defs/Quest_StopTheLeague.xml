        <description>An ultratech weapon of mass destruction repurposed to work in a network that will blanket the planet in a lethal gas. If a planet has enough of them they can all be activated at the same time to begin the somewhat lengthy process of blanketing the world, but this network will be broken if the main one is destroyed.</description>

<!-- 
Use QuestNode_Incident to create the next quest
Make it one long quest so StorytellerCompProperties_RefiringUniqueQuest doesn't have any issues?
Total of 4 sites to raid, each one with better defenses(higher points) than the last
Set up an epic quest system similar to RelicHunt's
  May want to make something that checks for the highest hero rank in the colony so players can only receive the quest when they have an S-rank hero
Becoming enemies with The Hero Organization will NOT cause a quest failure, but the player must be allies to receive the quest in the first place
Use QuestNode_ChangeFactionGoodwill on The Organization and The League at each stage to ensure ally/enemy status
    Allows for player trickery between stages, but intentions become clear after each stage
Needs custom site stuff for each part
